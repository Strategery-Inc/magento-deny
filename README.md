<h1>Strategery - Deny</h1>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Allow administrators to setup a master user and password for the entire frontend.</p>
<h3>How this works?</h3>
<p>First you need to specify an user and password in the extension system configuration. After you enable the extension all the frontend URL's will be blocked by a login form.</p>
<p>The form will validate the user / password and the it will create a session to allow the user to navigate the frontend.</p>
<h3>How this extension will help me?</h3>
<p>Let's say for example that your store is been developed and you don't want that real customers or your competition see the store until it's finished.</p>
<p>With this extension you will be able to block the frontend for everyone that doesn't have the master user and password.</p>
<h2>How to use it in simple steps:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Go to System / Configuration / Strategery Extensions / Deny</li>
<li>Enable the extension</li>
<li>Configure your master user and password</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
</ul>
